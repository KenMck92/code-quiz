# code-quiz

## Description
HTML:
I created 2 HTML for my questions and for my scoreboard. in the HTML I created a different elements to display questions in my js and buttons to start and submit my coding quiz. My css and js were linked successfully to work with each other. 

CSS:
In CSS I added text alignments and borders to my answer choices. I also added a hover to my answer bottoms when you hover over the options to choose from. 

Javascript:
In Javascript I created multiple variables and functions to correlate to my html. I added if statements and for loops to work with my questions answered correctly or incorrectly. I added a timer that starts when the quiz starts and decreases 10 seconds for every wrong answer. I also used JSON to log all of the test results in the local storage.
